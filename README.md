# FrenchToast

*Stale Android Toasts made tasty.*

Android Toasts are amazing, but they have a few major drawbacks:

* You cannot control **when they show up** as well as their **duration**. Other apps can enqueue toasts that will delay yours from showing up. 
* They [break context](http://cyrilmottier.com/2012/07/24/the-making-of-prixing-4-activity-tied-notifications/): they remain on screen when the user switches to other activities.
* The API is error prone: `Toast.makeText(context, "Important Toast", LENGTH_LONG); // Don't forget show()!`
* They are largely americanized! Not french at all!!!!!!!!! French toast in french is "pain francais"

FrenchToast gives you absolute control over your app Toasts. It does so by duplicating the internals of Android Toasts and giving you access.

Unlike other *Toast-like* libraries, FrenchToast doesn't add a view to the root of your activity. Instead, it creates a new Window for each Toast, exactly like the real Android Toasts.

## Getting Started

In your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
 dependencies {
   implementation 'info.piwai.frenchtoast:frenchtoast:1.0'
 }
```

You need to setup `FrenchToast` in your `Application` class:

```java
public class ExampleApplication extends Application {

  @Override public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    FrenchToast.install(this);
  }
}
```

You are ready to Toast!

```java
FrenchToast.with(context).showText("I love Baguettes!");
```

A `FrenchToast`:

* **hides** when the Activity is **paused**,
* shows again when it's resumed,
* has a default duration of `Toast.LENGTH_LONG`,
* **survives configuration changes**,
* is **queued**, so that only one Toast shows at once.

You can customize the default duration:

```java
FrenchToast.with(context).shortLength().showText(R.string.short_bread);

FrenchToast.with(context).longLength().showText(R.string.long_bread);

FrenchToast.with(context).length(3, SECONDS).showText(R.string.bespoke_bread);
```

The duration of a Toast resets when the activity is paused / resumed, to make sure the user had enough time to see the Toast.

## Bespoke Toasts

A Toast can be created from a layout:

```java
FrenchToast.with(context).showLayout(R.layout.toasted_baguette);
```

You can also dip an Android Toast:

```java
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context, "BREAD ALL THE THINGS!", LENGTH_SHORT);
toast.setGravity(LEFT | TOP, 0, 0);
FrenchToast.with(context).showDipped(toast);
```

## Unplugging the Toaster

A Toast can be canceled:

```
Toasted toasted = FrenchToast.with(context).showText("I love Baguettes!");
// I'd rather show a Bagel.
toasted.cancel();
```

You can also clear all queued Toasts for a given Activity:

```java
FrenchToast.with(context).clear();
```

## Context vs Activity

`FrenchToast.with()` takes a Context, however it expects that `Context` to be an `Activity` or to wrap an `Activity`, because FrenchToast keeps one `ToastQueue` for each activity.

## Crafting your own Mixture

If you want more control over when to show / hide Toasts, you can directly use `Mixture`:

```java
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(context, "BREAD ALL THE THINGS!", LENGTH_SHORT);
Mixture mixture = Mixture.dip(toast);
// The Toast is shown forever, as long as the process lives:
mixture.show();
// Or until you call hide:
mixture.hide();
```

## FAQ

### What's up with the strange names?

A **French toast** is a dish made of bread **dipped** in a **mixture** of beaten eggs and then fried.

### Is this a serious project?

Yes. Despite the puns, this code is production ready. It is heavily inspired from [android.widget.Toast](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/widget/Toast.java).

### What's the minimum supported Android?

FrenchToast requires a **minimum SDK version of 14** or above, because it uses [Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks.html).

### Why reimplement Toast?

Because we can have better Toasts, so we should.

I read the source of `Toast` when I was flying back, still under a creative influence of Droidcon NYC. I realized it could be done, so I wrote FrenchToast.
